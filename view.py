    - List 
        lists the available I2C circuits.
        the --> indicates the target device that will receive individual commands
    - xxx:[command]
        sends the command to the device at I2C address xxx 
        and sets future communications to that address
        Ex: "102:status" will send the command status to address 102
    - all:[command]
        sends the command to all devices
    - Poll[,x.xx]
        command continuously polls all devices
        the optional argument [,x.xx] lets you set a polling time
        where x.xx is greater than the minimum %0.2f second timeout.
        by default it will poll every %0.2f seconds
    >> Pressing ctrl-c will stop the polling
